# Portal Video
The app is Dockerized. Therefore, don't worry about the NodeJS version nor MongoDB. The client and the server are under the same root folder `(app)`

## What is the app about?
It's a simple portal video where you first have to log in and you can check a list of videos. You can watch them and also rate them. I only did the front, the back waw already done.

> NOTE: Because it is a simple app, I don't make use of `Redux` (I did but it had no sense for an small app).

## How to run the app?
* First make sure you have Docker installed.
* The run `Docker build . -t portal-video`
* The run `docker-compose up`
