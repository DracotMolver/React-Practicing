# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is just the tutorial from React's website.

##What is it about?
It's just the simple Tic-Tac-Toe. The code is almost similar, but with slightly differences.

> In the folder `component` I made `jsx` files based on the exemple of the webiste, but they are splitted into three files instead having all in one.

* components/
    * **App.jsx**: It contains the import to the Board component.
    * **Board.jsx**: It contains all the code of the board component.
    * **Saquere.jsx** It contains all the code of the board component.
