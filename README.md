The idea is to upload some small React app to show how to use react in a simple way and also get some feedback from people with experience in React. These app are part of my journy learning React and I totally felt in love with it.

* [PortalVideo (v16.3.2)](https://github.com/DracotMolver/React-Practicing/tree/master/PortalVideo) - *A very simple video portal that I had to do for a job postulation.*

* [ReactTutorial (v16.3.2)](https://github.com/DracotMolver/React-Practicing/tree/master/ReactTutorial) - *The tic-tac-toe game tutorial that you find on the React's website*

* [Test-enzyme (v16.2.0)](https://github.com/DracotMolver/React-Practicing/tree/master/Test-enzyme) - *A very simple configuration to work with Enzyme to test your app. It make use of Karma. (This was my first successful React testing).*

* [DragAndDrop (v16.3.2)](https://github.com/DracotMolver/React-Practicing/tree/master/DragAndDrop) - *A very small and simple app where I make use of tests*
