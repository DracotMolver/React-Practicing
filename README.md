The idea is to upload some small React app to show how to use react in a simple way and also get some feedback from people with experience in React. These app are part of my journy learning React and I totally felt in love with it.

* [PortalVideo (v16.2.0)](https://github.com/DracotMolver/React-Practicing/tree/master/PortalVideo) (The name of this project should be changed). - *A very simple video portal that I had to do for a job postulation.*

* [ReactTutorial (v16.0.0)](https://github.com/DracotMolver/React-Practicing/tree/master/ReactTutorial) - *The tic-tac-toe game tutorial that you find on the React's website*

* [PostTimeline (v16.0.0)](https://github.com/DracotMolver/React-Practicing/tree/master/PostTimeline) - *An small aplication based on a tutorial called 30-days-of-react-ebook-fullstackio. The pdf is avaible in the `file` folder*
